                Currently most of my prjects have taken place during my Study of Creative Technology at the University
                of Twente. Over the past 5 modules
                I have partaken in multiple hackathons, as well as finished a plethora of assignments, which yielded
                magnificent results.

                    The most notable one from module 2 is a project conducted in the range of an assignment, in which we were promted
                    to recreate a invention by Leonardo
                    Da Vinci. I chose to recreate the design of an aerial screw via blender and implemented basic user
                    interaction using unity and WebGL.

                    In module 4 the project focused more on the creative part of the curriculum. It follows that we designed a interactive art installation for the
                    chosen technology/topic of origami. Our idea was to create a automatic mechanism which folded and unfolded a origami piece, which contained a japanese
                    haiku talking about one of the many meanings of origami.

                    Module 5 was our elective module, in which i chose the track Smart Tech. Smart Tech focused more on the electrical engineering side 
                    of things, such as PID controllers or interfacing analog sensors. This theory accumulated in the final project in which we were presented
                    the task to build a robot which could solve a mace. More requirements were that the goal of the robot was given to him with a supersonic
                    frequency, which it needed to demodulate. To recognize the final position we added a barcode scaner to the robot which stopped when it red the 
                    correct bar code. The movement was hard coded, as that yielded the fastest result. Based on this result we won the first place in the accompanying
                    competion.
